# Soobi—A Funky Displayface


Soobi is a single-font display typeface designed to evoke a funky aura. In contrast, maintaining unique letter anatomy allows for consistent reading flow and accessibility.

Inspired by typefaces such as Cooper Black, designed in 1919 by Oswald Bruce Cooper, and Hobeaux, designed in 2015 by James Edmonson, Soobi aims to vary stroke form drastically by introducing squished and bloated shapes ranging from all its glyphs. Soobi’s varying strokes often relate to “noodles” or a soupy consistency; this is intentional as the name “Soobi” comes from saying the word “soupy” with a mouthful, precisely what the sketches of the letterforms appeared as.

A crucial goal for Soobi is to capture well-rounded accessibility in its letterforms, allowing for easy-to-read headlines and, on rarer occasions, body copy. Many characters like the lowercase “l” and capital “D” feature distinguishing characteristics not found in any other glyphs. Several lowercase letters also feature a unique dip in their shoulders, most prominently seen on the lowercase “n,” and most counters resembling the letter “O” use a slight hourglass figure to create uniformity.

Soobi required extensive learning and research, such as reading various books and consulting manuals online for the software used to create the typeface, Glyphs App 3. From months of designing individual glyphs, to hours of formulating and syncing kerning groups, the 76 complete glyph set of Soobi had been born. The included glyphs comprise capital A-Z, lowercase a-z, digits 0-9, and nine core punctations.
